# Sakuga MEGAJUMP

In animation, each second counts. This extension adds a useful button next to Sakuga Booru media links when not on the Sakuga Booru website. That's it!

Use of Sakuga Booru's animation archive is not uncommon in blogs and discussion about animation. However, when an MP4 or GIF from sakugabooru is shared by someone, it is difficult to dig deeper into the credits of the clip when one wants to. One cannot arrive at the detailed page for a clip on Sakuga Booru without a manual search.

Sakuga MEGAJUMP adds a button to jump over that trouble on any website.

* This extension can't find the source of random anime clips. It is only useful in the (common) case where blogs play a video directly from Sakuga Booru.
